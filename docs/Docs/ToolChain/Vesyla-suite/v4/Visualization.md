# Visualization of DRRA Fabric

The visualization of the DRRA fabric is generated by the `archvis` command of the Vesyla-suite. The visualization is generated in the form of a PDF file and an SVG file.

## Command

Assuming you want to generate the visualization of the DRRA fabric to the current directory according to the architectural description file `arch.json`, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ vesyla-suite archvis -a arch.json -o .
```

After the command is executed, you will find one PDF file and one SVG file are generated in the current directory. Both contains the same visualization of the DRRA fabric.
