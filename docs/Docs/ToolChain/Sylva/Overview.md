# Sylva Overview

Sylva is a tool for application-level synthesis (ALS). It accept a synchronous dataflow (SDF) graph as input and generates a solution after the DSE process. Currently, Sylva generate a solution based on idealized hardware. Further assembly process need to be implemented to automatically finalize the solution.
