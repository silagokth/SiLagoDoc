# Overview

## DRRA-2

[DRRA-2](Explanations/DRRA/Overview.md) is the second version of the Dynamic Reconfigurable Resource Array (DRRA). It is also a coarse-grained reconfigurable array that can be used to accelerate the execution of streaming applications. It improves upon the DRRA-1 design by simplifying the cell architecture and the interconnect scheme. It also increases the customizability and extendability of the fabric.
