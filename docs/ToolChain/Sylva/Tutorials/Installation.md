#Installation and Usage

Sylva and its dependency packages have to be installed on your system to use the tool chain. The following sections describe how to install Vesyla and its dependency packages.

## Sylva Installation

Sylva is currently hosted on GitHub at [silagokth/sylva](https://github.com/silagokth/sylva). The tool chain is now written in Python (We plan to change this in the future). We use a specific version of python with specific dependencies. However, we provide a setup script and you can simply run the script to have the tool chain installed in your system.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script was tested on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS. It will install a Python environment in your project main directory. The tool chain runs on this python environment.

## Example Installation (Optional)

Provided testcases are included in the Git repository. Now, they are already compiled and ready-to-go after you install Sylva Tool chain.
